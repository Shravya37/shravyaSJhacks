## SJSUConnect

San Jose is a place of opportunity, innovation, and creativity. Many who come here search for opportunities to advance their career and lives, yet we still face a homelessness crisis. This program allows for members of our community facing homelessness to have a fighting chance at an education, while studying at San Jose State University

If you are a student here at SJSU, and are experiencing issues with housing, or are homeless, we can help. Our program provides housing through the dorms at SJSU in exchange for community service and a job, allowing you to have a steady income, a place to live, something to put on your resume, while serving your community and helping make San Jose a more beautiful place.

Simply input your information and you will be able to find specific job positions available for you to apply. You will be matched with an advisor nearby, and will receive help with your journey continuing your education with a focus on helping you grow as a person!
